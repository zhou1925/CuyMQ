# CuyMQ

> 🐹 This project is a **small version of RabbitMQ** called **CuyMQ**, built just for fun and learning.  

CuyMQ is a lightweight, high-performance, and persistent message broker written in Go.  
It is designed with resource-constrained environments like **Raspberry Pis**, emphasizing:

- 🧠 **Low memory footprint**
- ⚡ **Efficient CPU usage**
- 🌐 **Resilience to unstable networks** (common in rural areas)
- 🎯 **Simplicity and efficiency** over complexity

While inspired by RabbitMQ’s concepts, **CuyMQ** prioritizes minimalism and performance.
